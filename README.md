# Project: Fake News Detection
Built a model to accurately classify a piece of news as REAL or FAKE. Using sklearn, I built a TfidfVectorizer on the dataset. Then, I initialized a PassiveAggressive Classifier and fit the model. In the end, the accuracy score and the confusion matrix tell how well the model fares.
